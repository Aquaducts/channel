# channel  
*by Aquaducts*

Channel was made to be super easy to self-host and use. It consists of one [main server](./spire/) and many [runners](./runner/). Self-hosting Channel requires that you have a couple things installed: LXC (`sudo apt-get install lxc-dev` for Ubuntu/Debian), Rust, and PostgreSQL.
