# Bamboo

Using **bamboo** requires you have the following installed:  
- LXC
- Postgres
- Rust

Bamboo is a CI service that is made to be extremely easy to setup and use while still allowing for advanced usage. At it's simplest Bamboo is nothing more
than a bunch of **Runnersr** and the main server, the **Spire**. Runners connect to the main server and wait patiently for jobs to be sent to them.

This is very much still in development and most security measures haven't been put in place yet, use at your own risk. 

(Commands to run it wont be provided till a more stable version is released, sorry.)
